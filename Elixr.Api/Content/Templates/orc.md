### Physical Description
Lightish, green skin, verging on gray, and often covered in scars, Orcs have an intimidating presence. Two or three heads higher than the average human, and 50 pounds more, due mostly to muscle mass, other races tend to steer clear of Orcs when they can.

### Culture
Orcs hail from a tradition of honor through battle. Tests of strength are not uncommon, and the chief of the tribe is often made such through dispatching the previous chief. Orcs are generally not welcome amongst the other races for their manner and aggressive tendencies. Humans can relate the most to their primal nature and it is not unheard of for them to work together in large cities where the culture of the various races tends to be mixed.
