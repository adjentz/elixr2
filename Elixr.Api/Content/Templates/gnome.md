### Physical Description
Known for their eccentric looks, Gnomes stand half as tall as the average human and weigh 25% or so as them. However, it is not their size that one notices, but their eccentric dress and manner. Tan skin, green or brown eyes, and any number of hair colors — often artificially dyed  — are what is seen most often on Gnomes.

### Culture
An inquisitive and excited nature, Gnomes are always tinkering, either with magic or machinery, and discovering new things. Sometimes thought to be whimsical, when a Gnome sets their mind to doing something, they’ll do it, even it takes their full lifespan of about 300 years.

### Sample Names
Gnomes love names,  they often change what one they use for themselves, sometimes multiple times in the middle of the same conversation.

Male: Garbo, Ziltix, Thrall Qulinn
