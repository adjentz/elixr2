You animate skeletons and corpses, imbuing them with a semblance of life.

These undead do not have intelligence, but will blindly follow simple orders you give them. 
Simple orders include: “Guard this area”, “Attack those people”, “Walk that direction”.

The undead will mindlessly obey until they are destroyed, or successfully complete their order. On completion, the undead remain in the same place until a new order is given by you.

You can animate 1 corpse/skeleton for every 2 points of Energy Channeled.
