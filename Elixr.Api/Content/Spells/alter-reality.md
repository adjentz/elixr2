Alter Reality is the most versatile spell. The spell allows you to permanently make a change to the world. 

The Energy Requirement for the spell depends on the magnitude of the requested effect. The GM determines this using similar spells (to the desired effect) as a reference, as well as their own discretion.

Additionally, Energy cast for this spell must be sacrificed, meaning that the caster's Current Energy is reduced by the amount they Channel. 

It is not recommended for lower-level characters to learn this spell, as the Energy Requirement will almost always be higher than their Max Energy.
