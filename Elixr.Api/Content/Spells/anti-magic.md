Those that cast spells within a 10ft radius of you, or an object you touch when casting the spell have the Effective Channeled Energy reduced by a 1:1 ratio.

For example, if you Channel 3 points of Energy to cast this spell, and someone casts Energy Blast, Fire within the radius -- channeling 7 points of Energy to do so, 
their spell is cast as though they had instead Channeled only 4 points of Energy (7 - 3 = 4).

The radius can be increased by 5ft for every 2 additional points of Energy channeled. This must be specified before casting.
