You project a sound or image to a location that you can see.

For each point of Energy Channeled, roll 1d6. If the result of the roll exceeds the target's Concentration Defense the target believes the illusion to be real, and must act accordingly.

The target's effective Concentration Defense changes based on what illusion is created, as shown by this table:

Realism|Effect Concentration Defense
---|---
Sounds OR Image only | -2
Small Image + Sounds | +0
Medium Image + Sounds | +2
Large Image + Sounds | +5
Massive Image + Sounds | +8

If the illusion is something hard to believe, such as seeing a mermaid on land, or someone's dead brother, the target's effective Concentration Defense increases even more at the GM's discretion.
